In this vignette, calculations to estimate volumes and quantities relevent for the droplet making and picoinjection workflow are carried out.




How many droplets are there in x mm of Tygon/PTFE tubing?


```{r}
diameterDroplet <- 30e-6 # 30 micron droplets
diameterTubing <- 0.8e-3 # 0.8 mm ID PTFE tubing
```

Assuming close-packing of equal spheres: fraction of space occupied by spheres is

$$\frac{\pi}{3 \sqrt{2}} \approx 0.74048$$


Volume of a cylinder with radius $r$ and height $h$:

$$V = \pi r^2 h$$
